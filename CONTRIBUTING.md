# Contributing

Carl is an open-source project and contributions of all kinds
are welcome.

Code contributions should follow these guidelines:

* all changes by pull request (PR);
* a PR solves one problem (do not mix problems together in one PR) with the
  minimal set of changes;
* describe why you are proposing the changes you are proposing;
* new code needs to come with a test;
* no merging if travis is red.

These are not hard rules to be enforced, but guidelines.
