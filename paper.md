# Summary

Carl is a likelihood-free inference toolbox for Python. Its goal is
to provide tools to support inference in the likelihood-free setup,
including density ratio estimation algorithms, parameterized supervised
learning and calibration procedures.

Methodological details regarding likelihood-free inference with calibrated
classifiers can be found in the companion paper [@Cranmer:2015-llr].

Future development aims at providing further density ratio estimation
algorithms, along with alternative algorithms for the likelihood-free setup,
such as ABC.
